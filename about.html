  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p style="font-family: cursive;";">By 2020, we found that many key innovations in global development werenâ€™t getting the attention they deserved. Believing there had to be a better way to do aid, we started an experiment. We invited any ardent gamers across the globe to pitch his or her earth-changing idea. The 300+ participants ranging from people in the rural areas to those researching in NASA had shared their ideas.</p>
  <p style="font-family: cursive;">The event was a success, and we realized good ideas can come from anyone, anywhere, at any time.  So, Keeping account of these innovations, I developed this site. Today, more than 15 countries have our headquarters.</p>
